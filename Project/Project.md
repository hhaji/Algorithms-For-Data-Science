# Course Project Resources:
Several programming assignments that cover the topic of the course. Students individually implement given assignments in recommended language or tool, and periodically demonstrate the progress to teaching assistants. The following resources may be helpful for those still undecided about their course project.

## Datasets:
* [DataHub](https://datahub.io/) has a lot of structured data in formats such as RDF and CSV. 
* [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
* [CrowdFlower Data for Everyone library](http://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone)
* [Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html)

## Coding:
You may also find it helpful to read Python and its wonderful libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), but note that in this course it’s really not necessary to know Python. Instead, just use one of the following softwares to figure things out along the way.

* [Orange](http://orange.biolab.si/), open source data analytics and mining through visual programming or Python scripting. Components for visualization, rule learning, clustering, model evaluation, and more.
* [RapidMiner](http://rapidminer.com/), makes data science teams more productive through a unified platform for data prep, machine learning, and model deployment.
* [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/index.html), collection of machine learning algorithms for solving real-world data mining problems. It is written in Java and runs on almost any platform.
