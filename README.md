## Class time, Location and Examinations:
Saturday and Monday 08:00-09:30 AM (Fall 2018), Room 208. 

### Two written exams:
Midterm Examination: Monday 1397/09/12, 08:00-10:00 <br>
Final Examination:

## Grading:
* Homework – 15% <br>
— Will consist of mathematical problems and/or programming assignments.
* Midterm – 35%
* Endterm – 50%

## Prerequisites:
General mathematical sophistication; and a solid understanding of Algorithms, Linear Algebra, and Probability Theory, at the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate level, or equivalent.

## Topics:
Have a look at some reports of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or Stanford students ([CS224N](http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/2015/), [CS224D](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports_2016.html)) to get some general inspiration.

## Account:
It is necessary to have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to share your projects. It offers plans for both private repositories and free accounts. Github is like the hammer in your toolbox, therefore, you need to have it!

## Academic Honor Code:
Honesty and integrity are vital elements of the academic works. All your submitted assignments must be entirely your own (or your own group's).

We’ll follow the standard of Department of Mathematical Sciences approach: 
* You can get help, but you MUST acknowledge the help on the work you hand in
* Failure to acknowledge your sources is a violation of the Honor Code
*  You can talk to others about the algorithm(s) to be used to solve a homework problem; as long as you then mention their name(s) on the work you submit
* You should not use code of others or be looking at code of others when you write your own: You can talk to people but have to write your own solution/code

## Questions?
I'll be having office hours for this course on Saturday and Monday (09:30 AM--12:00 AM). If this isn't convenient, email me at hhaji@sbu.ac.ir or talk to me after class.
