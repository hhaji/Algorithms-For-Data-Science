# Project with Orange3


This project is an example of machine learning.

In this project, we have a data image file containing 104 images. (I search and download these images of Google)

Using Hireacial algorithm, we cluster these images.

Then choose tow new images that do not existing images in this file, and add it to the data image file,
now we have 106 images in data image file.

By re-running the algorithm, you see a new clustering of label tow images correctly. 

## Note 1: If you look at all the clustering, you see in a few clusters there is a image that does not belong to the cluster.
## To solve this problem, the number of data will increase.

## Note 2: I suggest you read the power Point program before running.
